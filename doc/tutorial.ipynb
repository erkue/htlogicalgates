    "- `stab_code = StabilizerCode(\"4_2_2\")`: First, we create a `StabilizerCode` object. It contains the stabilizer code for which we wish to find a logical circuit. As an argument we pass `\"4_2_2\"`, which indicates the $\\llbracket4,2,2\\rrbracket$ color code. We can querry its stabilizers and logical Pauli operators and we can also create an object for our own stabilizer code. More information is provided [below](#stabilizercode).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conn = Connectivity(\"circular\", num_qubits=4)`: Here, we create a `Connenctivity` object containing information about connections between qubits on the real hardware. Two-qubit gates are only allowed between connected qubits. Here, we use a `\"circular\"` connectivity on `num_qubits=4` qubits. There are multiple available connectivities and we can also create our own connectivity. More information is provided [below](#connectivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `log_gate = Circuit(\"H 0\", num_qubits=2)`: Finally, we create a `Circuit` object. We pass the string `\"H 0\"`, indicating the circuit, and the number of qubits its acts on `\"num_qubits=2\"`. This circuit indicates the logical action on the stabilizer code for which we tailor a circuit that implements this action on the logical level. For more information about the `Circuit` class, see [below](#circuit). \n",

Furthermore, we indicate the number of controlled-Z gate layers we use in tailoring the circuit by using the argument `num_cz_layers`. Generally speaking, more controlled-Z layer make the ansatz more expressive and can lead to circuits with less two-qubit gates in total, while increasing runtime. If you can not find a specific gate, try to increase the number of controlled-Z gate layers."
