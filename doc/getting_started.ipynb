As an argument we pass `\"4_2_2\"`, which indicates the $\\llbracket4,2,2\\rrbracket$ color code. We can querry its stabilizers and logical Pauli operators and we can also create an object for our own stabilizer code.\n",

Two-qubit gates are only allowed between connected qubits. Here, we use a `\"circular\"` connectivity on `num_qubits=4` qubits. There are multiple available connectivities and we can also create our own connectivity.\n",

We pass the string `\"H 0\"`, indicating the circuit, and the number of qubits its acts on `\"num_qubits=2\"`. Note that we count **qubits starting at 0**. This circuit indicates the logical action on the stabilizer code for which we tailor a circuit that implements this action on the logical level.\n",

Generally speaking, more controlled-Z layer make the ansatz more expressive and can lead to circuits with less two-qubit gates in total, while increasing runtime. If you can not find a specific gate, try to increase the number of controlled-Z gate layers."
